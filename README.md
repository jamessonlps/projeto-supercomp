# Maratona de Filmes üíªüçø

Welcome to Maratona de Filmes, a supercomputing project that tackles the challenging Binary Knapsack problem! We explore three powerful heuristics: Greedy, Random, and an Exhaustive approach, all with the help of parallelization using GPU and OpenMP. Are you ready to dive into this cinematic adventure? üé•üöÄ

## What is the Binary Knapsack Problem? üéí

The Binary Knapsack Problem is a classic combinatorial optimization challenge. Imagine you have a knapsack with limited capacity and a list of items, each with its own value and weight. The goal is to maximize the total value of the items you can fit into the knapsack, while respecting the capacity constraint. It's like planning the best selection of movies for a marathon, choosing wisely which movies to bring along!

## Heuristics for the Solution üß†

Our Maratona de Filmes offers three heuristic approaches to solve the Binary Knapsack Problem:

1. **Greedy Heuristic**: A greedy strategy that selects items with the highest value-to-weight ratio. Will choosing the most valuable movies be enough for the best cinematic experience?

2. **Random Heuristic**: A bold approach that randomly selects a set of items for the knapsack. Will luck be on our side to find the perfect combination of movies?

3. **Exhaustive Approach**: A complete solution that exhaustively examines all possibilities to find the best selection of movies, analyzing all possible combinations. It may be time-consuming for a large number of items, but we guarantee the optimal solution!

## Parallelization with GPU and OpenMP ‚ö°üî•

To make our marathon even more exciting, we harness the power of parallelization to speed up the Binary Knapsack problem-solving process. We make use of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and OpenMP to distribute the workload across multiple processing cores, making our movie search faster and more efficient!

## How to Run the Project? üöÄ

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have the required libraries installed for the project, including CUDA for GPU parallelization and OpenMP for parallelization across multiple processing cores.

2. **Cloning the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamessonlps/projeto-supercomp.git
```


3. **Running the Code**: Navigate to the cloned directory and execute the main project file. For example:

```bash
cd projeto-supercomp
make
python3 ./main
```


Make sure to provide the necessary input arguments, such as the knapsack capacity and the list of items with their respective values and weights.

4. **Enjoy the Maratona**: Watch the magic happen as our supercomputing project finds the best selection of movies for your marathon. Prepare the popcorn and enjoy!
